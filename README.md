# 🔢 Gradient Descent – Visualization in Python

This repository contains a clean and visual implementation of **Gradient Descent**, one of the most widely used optimization algorithms in Machine Learning.

The script includes two demonstrations:
1. Gradient Descent applied to the simple quadratic function **f(x) = x²**
2. Gradient Descent from multiple initial values on the shifted quadratic **f(x) = (x − 3)² + 4**

Both examples visually show how the algorithm moves step-by-step toward the global minimum.
